## Step 1: Access and Sync Shipping Profiles

Navigate to **Shipping** in the left menu to view your profiles. Sync from Shopify for instant alignment of zones and rates, or use **Add Shipping Zone** to build custom ones.

## Step 2: Explore Shipping Zones

Within a profile (e.g., *General Profile*), review zones like **Domestic** or **International**. Each displays rate names, delivery estimates, price ranges, COD status, and quick actions for edits or toggles.

## Step 3: Build a New Shipping Zone

Select **Add Shipping Zone** to create targeted delivery areas. Name the zone internally, then choose **State & Country** for broad coverage or **Pincode** for specificsâ€”select multiples or upload CSVs for efficiency.

## Step 4: Refine Delivery Rates

Edit rates via the pencil icon to tailor customer-facing details:  
- **Rate Name & Timeline**: E.g., "Standard Delivery in 2-5 days."  
- **Pricing Type**: Order value or weight-based, with min/max conditions.  
- **COD & Fees**: Activate per zone, add charges to mitigate risks.  
- **Exclusions**: Block non-serviceable PINs via CSV upload.
