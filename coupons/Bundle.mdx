  - *Fixed Amount Off* – Deduct a set value from the total.  
  - *Percentage Off* – Apply a percent-based reduction.  
- **Scope:**  
  - *Specific Products* – Limit to certain SKUs.  
  - *Collections* – Apply to predefined collections.  
- **Quantity Limit:** Restrict eligible quantity under the bundle to avoid over-discounting.
