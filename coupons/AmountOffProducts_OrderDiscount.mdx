## Step 1: Setup

Define triggers and application in **Setup**. Choose code-based or automatic activation, then specify order-wide or product-specific discounts with percentage/fixed values and optional caps.

## Step 4: Usage Limits

Safeguard with **Usage Limits**: global/per-customer caps, stacking permissions, active dates/times, and COD disablement.
