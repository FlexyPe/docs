## Overview

The **Upsell** feature allows you to drive higher order values by presenting additional, relevant items to customers during checkout.  
By recommending complementary or related products at the right moment, upselling enhances both sales and customer satisfaction — without increasing acquisition costs.

## Step 1: Add Upsell Products

Click **Add Products** on the top-right to configure upsells for specific products.

/>

**Options include:**  
- Select one or more products from your catalog.  
- Include or exclude specific variants.  
- Activate or deactivate upsells with a simple toggle.  

This is ideal for **complementary product recommendations.**  
*Example:* Suggest a *“Protein Shaker”* when a customer adds *“Whey Protein”* to their cart.

## Step 2: Add Upsell Collections

Instead of individual products, you can promote full collections.

/>

**Options include:**  
- Choose entire collections like *“Accessories”* or *“New Arrivals.”*  
- Automatically include all products within that collection.  
- Enable or disable upsells at the collection level.  

This works best for **seasonal or category-based promotions.**  
*Example:* Offer the *“Winter Essentials Collection”* when a customer purchases *“Thermal Wear.”*

## Step 3: Checkout Display

Once configured, upsell offers appear seamlessly within the checkout experience.

  alt="Upsell checkout view"
/>

Customers will see:  
- Recommended products or collections alongside their cart summary.  
- Quick add-to-cart options with visible prices and availability.  
- Non-intrusive presentation that keeps checkout flow uninterrupted.  

This ensures upsells feel like **helpful suggestions**, not distractions.

## Strategic Value

Upsells help you:  
- **Increase average order value** through relevant add-ons or upgrades.  
- **Promote slow-moving inventory** by pairing it with high-demand products.  
- **Enhance customer experience** with thoughtful, timely recommendations.  
- **Run seasonal or thematic campaigns** effortlessly via collection-level targeting.  

By combining individual and collection-based upsells, FlexyPe lets you build dynamic offers that boost revenue while keeping the customer journey smooth and personalized.
