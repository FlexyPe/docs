## Best Practices

<Warning>
**Don't Overcomplicate:** Too many customizations can overwhelm customers. Test each change and measure impact on conversion rates before adding more.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Mobile First:** Over 70% of e-commerce traffic is mobile. Always preview customizations on mobile devices before publishing.
</Tip>

<Info>
**A/B Test Layouts:** Use different coupon and payment layouts for different customer segments to identify what works best for your audience.
</Info>

<Check>
**Consistent Branding:** Ensure your logo, colors, and messaging match your main store. Inconsistency can reduce trust and increase abandonment.
