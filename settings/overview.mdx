The **Settings** section is your administrative control center within FlexyPe. It ensures your store’s checkout operations run smoothly — from business details and payment configurations to API integrations and user permissions.

A well-configured settings setup doesn’t just keep your checkout functional — it improves accuracy, speeds up reconciliation, and ensures compliance with local regulations.
