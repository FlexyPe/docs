## What You Can Do

- Set base tax rates for different states/regions
- Create tax overrides for specific product collections
- Configure exemptions (0% tax) for eligible items
- Ensure GST compliance across your store

---

## Adding a Tax Override

![Tax Override Setup](/images/settings/image9.png)

Configure custom tax rates for specific collections in three fields:

### Collection Name
The product collection you want to override.  
Example: `Books`, `Luxury`, `Healthcare`

Location (Scope)
Where this override applies:
- **India** - Applies nationwide
- **Karnataka** - Applies only in Karnataka
- **Maharashtra** - Applies only in Maharashtra
- (Select any state as needed)

### Tax Rate (%)
The custom tax percentage:
- `0` for tax-exempt items
- `5`, `12`, `18`, `28` for GST rates

Once saved, all products in that collection automatically use the override rate for the selected region.

## Migrating from Shopify

| Shopify Setup | FlexyPe Setup |
|---------------|---------------|
| Manual collection for grouping | **Collection Name** field |
| Override applies to collection | Same - create override |
| State/region rules | **Location** selector |
| Custom rate | **Tax Rate (%)** field |

### Examples

**Tax-exempt books nationwide:**
- Collection Name: `Books`
- Location: `India`
- Tax Rate: `0`

**Luxury items at 18% in Karnataka:**
- Collection Name: `Luxury`
- Location: `Karnataka`
- Tax Rate: `18`

---

## Important Notes

- **Customer exemptions override collection rules** - If a customer has tax-exempt status, it takes priority
- **Shopify automatic collections** - Must be manually recreated in FlexyPe before setting overrides
- **Updates apply immediately** - Changes recalculate taxes in real-time
- **Multiple states** - Create separate overrides for each state-collection combination

---
