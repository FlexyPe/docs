title: Abandoned Cart Recovery
---

The Abandoned Cart Recovery Webhook is triggered whenever a cart session is created or updated. It facilitates real-time synchronization of cart data with external systems, enabling accurate tracking of active shopping sessions. This webhook plays a vital role in identifying potential cart abandonment scenarios and allows businesses to automate recovery actions such as follow-up emails, whatsapp messages, personalized notifications, or remarketing efforts. By leveraging this integration, brands can engage customers at the right moment and significantly improve cart conversion rates.
